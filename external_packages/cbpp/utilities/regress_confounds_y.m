function [y, reg_y] = regress_confounds_y(y, confounds, existing_reg)
% [y, reg_y] = regress_confounds_y(y, confounds, existing_reg)
%
% This function regresses out confounds from prediction targets y. Note that regression coefficients should be 
% estimated using only training data.
%
% For training data, pass in y and the confounds to perform regression, obtaining the new y and regression coefficients
% reg_y. 
%
% For test data, also pass in the regression coefficients obtained from the training data. 
%
% Inputs:
%       - y           :
%                      NxT matrix containing T target values from N subjects
%       - confounds   :
%                      NxD matrix containing D confounds for N subjects.
%       - existing_reg:
%                      (Optional) Existing regression coefficients to use for regressing out confounds in the test set.
%
% Output:
%        - y    :
%                NxT matrix containing the target values with confounds removed
%        - reg_y:
%                (D+1)xT array containing the regression coefficient for each confound. The last element correspond to
%                the offset, i.e. a confound of constant 1.
